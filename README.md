## Research Questions

**(RQ1) “main effect notation”:**  
How time efficient and accurate are different types of notation for authoring a video-based learning module?

- **(RQ1.a) “time”** Which type of notation can help participants complete the authoring task in less working time (= faster)?

- **(RQ1.b) “accuracy”** Which type of notation can help participants complete the authoring task with less errors?

**(RQ2) “main effect experience”:**  
Is there an association between participants’ experience level and the corresponding authoring time and accuracy?

- **(RQ2.a) “time”** Does the experience level (novice, experienced) have an influence on the authoring time of a video-based learning module?

- **(RQ2.b) “accuracy”** Does the experience level (novice, experienced) have an influence on the number of errors for a created video-based learning module?

**(RQ3) “interaction effect notation & experience”**  
Does the combination of experience level and type of notation have an influence on the e efficiency and accuracy for authoring a video-based learning module?

- **(RQ3.a & c) “time“** Does the combination of experience level and type of notation have an influence on the authoring time of a video-based learning module? 

- **(RQ3.b & d) “accuracy”** Does the combination of experience level and type of notation have an influence on the number of errors for a created video-based learning module?

**(RQ4) “preference”**  
Is there an association between experience level and preference for a type of notation?

## Hypotheses

**(H1) “main effect notation”**  
- **(H1.a) “time”** Participants working with a natural language notation will complete the authoring task in less working time (= are faster) compared to participants working with a key-value notation.
- **(H1.b) “accuracy”** Participants working with a natural language notation will complete the authoring task with less errors compared to participants working with a key-value notation.

**(H2) “main effect experience”**  
- **(H2.a) “time”** Experienced participants will complete the authoring tasks (for both NL and KV) in less working time (= are faster) compared to novice participants.
- **(H2.b) “accuracy”** Experienced participants will complete the authoring tasks (for both NL and KV) with less errors compared to novice participants.

**(H3) “interaction effect notation & experience”**  
- **(H3.a) “experienced + kv = faster“** Experienced participants working with a key-value notation will complete the authoring task in less working time (= are faster) compared to experienced participants working with a natural language notation. 
- **(H3.b) “experienced + kv = better accuracy”** Experienced participants working with a key-value notation will complete the authoring task with less errors compared to experienced participants working with a natural language notation.
- **(H3.c) “novice + nl = faster”** Novice participants working with a natural language notation will complete the authoring task in less working time (= are faster) compared to novice participants working with a key-value notation.
- **(H3.d) “novice + nl = better accuracy”** Novice participants working with a natural language notation will complete the authoring task with less errors compared to novice participants working with a key-value notation.

**(H4) “preference”**  
There is an association - novice users will prefer the natural language notation and experienced users will prefer the key-value notation.

## Variables

**Independent Variables:**

**(1) Notation “within-subjects factor”:** participants have to create a video-based learning module by using the natural language (NL) notation and the key-value (KV) notation.

**(2) Experience Level “between-subjects factor”:** participants will be grouped into two groups based on their experience level being either novice or experienced educators/facilitators.

**(3) Sequence “between-subjects factor”:** within each experience level participants will start with different notations respectively. Namely AB: NL->KV and BA: KV->NL   

**Dependent Variables - measurements:**

**(1) Time “Efficiency”** - measured in duration in mm:ss —> transformed to mm,(ss/60)  
The dependent variable time is defined as the authoring time a participant needs in order to complete the authoring task.

**(2) Accuracy - measured in percentage**  
Saket et al. (2015) used measuring in percentage 0-100% —> answer correct (100%) incorrect (0%)
Based on quality criteria for assessment of problems in storyboard

**(3) Preference “Ranking”**

**(4) SUS score**
