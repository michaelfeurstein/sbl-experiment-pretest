## Study Design

In principle the experiment aims to compare two types of notations for a domain-specific language ([storyboard-language](https://github.com/michaelfeurstein/storyboard-language)), taking into account the experience level of participants. The language allows facilitators the creation (authoring) of video-based learning modules. Two types of notations are being evaluated: (1) a natural-language and (2) key-value.

The overall aim of this experiment is to determine whether the creation of a video-based learning module using a key-value based notation differs from using a natural language based notation for experienced as well as novice educators and facilitators.

This means participants of different level of experience should create video-based learning modules using a key-value based notation and using a natural-language based notation. Finally, they should assess the notations’ system usability and compare both notations based on their personal preference by ranking them.

The experiment in this study focuses on two types of text-based notation styles (factor: NOTATION; levels: key-value, natural-language) and two groups of users (factor: EXPERIENCE; levels: novice, advanced). This is a 2 x 2 mixed factorial design with the user experience being the between-subjects (block) factor and the type of notation being the within-subjects (repeated measures) factor.

The first group of users are students with little to no experience in authoring video-based learning content. The second group consists of lecturers/instructors and facilitators with experience in the use of video-based learning.

Figure 1 provides an overview of the experimental design. Within each group of users, two sequence groups will be formed: AB and BA. Thus, each sequence group will have two treatments (repeated measures): treatment A using the natural language notation style and treatment B using the key-value notation style. The sequence groups will be applied in a crossover design in order to take into account possible carry-over effects. For each treatment period, a different video with a set of instructions will be assigned. The video content and instructions text are not part of the study, therefore no random pool of videos is curated assigning each individual treatment with a unique video, but assigning only the treatment periods with different videos and instructions. The video itself is required as a building block for a video-based learning module and the instruction text is needed to tell the participant what authoring tasks need to be performed.

## Research Questions

**(RQ1) “main effect notation”:**  
How time efficient and accurate are different types of notation for authoring a video-based learning module?

- **(RQ1.a) “time”** Which type of notation can help participants complete the authoring task in less working time (= faster)?

- **(RQ1.b) “accuracy”** Which type of notation can help participants complete the authoring task with less errors?

**(RQ2) “main effect experience”:**  
Is there an association between participants’ experience level and the corresponding authoring time and accuracy?

- **(RQ2.a) “time”** Does the experience level (novice, experienced) have an influence on the authoring time of a video-based learning module?

- **(RQ2.b) “accuracy”** Does the experience level (novice, experienced) have an influence on the number of errors for a created video-based learning module?

**(RQ3) “interaction effect notation & experience”**  
Does the combination of experience level and type of notation have an influence on the e efficiency and accuracy for authoring a video-based learning module?

- **(RQ3.a & c) “time“** Does the combination of experience level and type of notation have an influence on the authoring time of a video-based learning module? 

- **(RQ3.b & d) “accuracy”** Does the combination of experience level and type of notation have an influence on the number of errors for a created video-based learning module?

**(RQ4) “preference”**  
Is there an association between experience level and preference for a type of notation?

## Hypotheses

**(H1) “main effect notation”**  
- **(H1.a) “time”** Participants working with a natural language notation will complete the authoring task in less working time (= are faster) compared to participants working with a key-value notation.
- **(H1.b) “accuracy”** Participants working with a natural language notation will complete the authoring task with less errors compared to participants working with a key-value notation.

**(H2) “main effect experience”**  
- **(H2.a) “time”** Experienced participants will complete the authoring tasks (for both NL and KV) in less working time (= are faster) compared to novice participants.
- **(H2.b) “accuracy”** Experienced participants will complete the authoring tasks (for both NL and KV) with less errors compared to novice participants.

**(H3) “interaction effect notation & experience”**  
- **(H3.a) “experienced + kv = faster“** Experienced participants working with a key-value notation will complete the authoring task in less working time (= are faster) compared to experienced participants working with a natural language notation. 
- **(H3.b) “experienced + kv = better accuracy”** Experienced participants working with a key-value notation will complete the authoring task with less errors compared to experienced participants working with a natural language notation.
- **(H3.c) “novice + nl = faster”** Novice participants working with a natural language notation will complete the authoring task in less working time (= are faster) compared to novice participants working with a key-value notation.
- **(H3.d) “novice + nl = better accuracy”** Novice participants working with a natural language notation will complete the authoring task with less errors compared to novice participants working with a key-value notation.

**(H4) “preference”**  
There is an association - novice users will prefer the natural language notation and experienced users will prefer the key-value notation.

## Variables

**Independent Variables:**

**(1) Notation “within-subjects factor”:** participants have to create a video-based learning module by using the natural language (NL) notation and the key-value (KV) notation.

**(2) Experience Level “between-subjects factor”:** participants will be grouped into two groups based on their experience level being either novice or experienced educators/facilitators.

**(3) Sequence “between-subjects factor”:** within each experience level participants will start with different notations respectively. Namely AB: NL->KV and BA: KV->NL   

**Dependent Variables - measurements:**

**(1) Time “Efficiency”** - measured in duration in mm:ss —> transformed to mm,(ss/60)  
The dependent variable time is defined as the authoring time a participant needs in order to complete the authoring task.

**(2) Accuracy - measured in percentage**  
Saket et al. (2015) used measuring in percentage 0-100% —> answer correct (100%) incorrect (0%)
Based on quality criteria for assessment of problems in storyboard

**(3) Preference “Ranking”**

**(4) SUS score**
