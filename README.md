## Study Design

In principle the experiment aims to compare two types of notations for a domain-specific language ([storyboard-language](https://github.com/michaelfeurstein/storyboard-language)). The language allows facilitators the creation (authoring) of video-based learning modules. Two types of notations are being evaluated: (1) a natural-language and (2) key-value.

The overall aim of this experiment is to determine whether the creation of a video-based learning module using a key-value based notation differs from using a natural language based notation in terms of efficiency (authoring time) and effectiveness (accuracy). 

This means participants of the study should create video-based learning modules using a key-value based notation and using a natural-language based notation respectively. Finally, they should assess the notations’ usability and rank the notations based on their personal preference.

The experiment in this study focuses on two types of text-based notation styles (factor: NOTATION; levels: key-value, natural-language). It is setup as a repeated measures within-subject crossover design (AB,BA) with the notation being the within-subjects factor. Each participant will work with both notations. Participants will therefore act as their own control group. In order to alleviate carry-over effects a cross over design is used.

Figure 1 provides an overview of the experimental design. Two sequence groups will be formed: AB and BA. Each sequence group will have two treatments (repeated measures) over two periods: treatment A using the natural language notation and treatment B using the key-value notation. The sequence groups will be applied in a crossover design in order to take into account possible carry-over effects. For each treatment period, a different video with a different set of instructions will be used. The video content and instructions text are not part of the study, therefore no random pool of videos is curated assigning each individual treatment with a unique video, but assigning only the treatment periods with different videos and instructions. The video itself is required as a building block for a video-based learning module and the instruction text is needed to tell the participant what authoring tasks need to be performed.

## Variables

**Independent Variables (manipulated):**

**(1) Notation “within-subjects factor”:** participants have to create a video-based learning module by using the natural language (NL) notation and the key-value (KV) notation.

**Dependent Variables - measurements:**

**(1) Time “Efficiency”** - measured in duration in mm:ss —> transformed to mm,(ss/60) (ratio)
The dependent variable time is defined as the authoring time a participant needs in order to complete the authoring task.

**(2) Accuracy "Effectiveness"** - measured in percentage (ratio)
Saket et al. (2015) used measuring in percentage 0-100% —> answer correct (100%) incorrect (0%)
Based on quality criteria for assessment of problems in storyboard

**(3) SUS score "Usability"** (ordinal)

**(4) Rank "Preference"** 

## Research Questions

The overall aim is to investigate which type of notation for the Storyboard-Language (DSL) meets the needs of facilitators and lecturers creating video-based learning content. Based on this overall aim we can formulate a main research goal (RG) utilizing the goal definition template from the (GQM) method (Basili et al. 1994; van Solingen 1999) as follows

**(RG) Research Goal:**
Analysis of the Storyboard Language for the purpose of comparing two types of notations with respect to its efficiency, effectiveness and usability for facilitators and lecturers who are involved in the authoring process vor video-based learning modules.

From this the following research questions are formulated:

**(RQ1) “main effect notation”:**  
How time efficient and accurate are different types of notation for authoring a video-based learning module?

- **(RQ1.a) “time”** Which type of notation can help participants complete the authoring task in less working time (= faster)?

- **(RQ1.b) “accuracy”** Which type of notation can help participants complete the authoring task with less errors?

**(RQ2) “Usability”**  
How do participants judge the usability of the two types of notations for authoring a video-based learning module?

**(RQ3) “Preference”**  
Which notations do participants prefer for authoring a video-based learning module?

## Hypotheses

The direction of the hypotheses are based on a preceding study evaluating preferences and usability measures between three types of notations (script, natural-language, key-value). From this study the key-value notation was preferred over the natural-language notation. This is why for our hypotheses formulation are directed towards the key-value notation.

**(H1) “Main Effect Notation”**  
- **(H1.a) “time”** Participants working with a key-value notation will complete the authoring task in less working time (= are faster) compared to participants working with a natural-language notation.
- **(H1.b) “Accuracy”** Participants working with a key-value notation will complete the authoring task with less errors (= are more accurate) compared to participants working with a natural-language notation.

**(H2) “Usability”**  
Participants working with the key-value notation will assess the notation with a better SUS score compared to the natural-language notation.

**(H3) “preference”**  
Participants will prefer the key-value notation over the natural-language notation.
